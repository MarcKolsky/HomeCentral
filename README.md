# HomeCentral

Home Central is a mobile application built in 2016.  This application was built for a customer, so I can only provide some screenshots.

Home Central was the brain child of a retiree who wanted a better way to keep track of and reference items in the household.  With Home Central you can store information on your appliances, electronics, furniture, etc.  Your household is at your fingertips.

The Home Central app was built using Xamarin Forms.  The client had a small budget, so Xamarin Forms presented the opportunity to build an application for both iOS and Android at the same time.  Much of the styling was directed by the client, but I provided some input in the functionality to bring some more modern features to the application.

Home Central uses a SQLite database to store all of the user data, and a custom app folder to store all of the photos taken by the user.  A cleanup script is called at the apps launch to ensure the database and app folder remain optimized and clear of unused data.  The Home Central app allows you to store data for up to 3 locations with the purchase of the app, and an option to purchase additional rooms from the in-app store.
